Things (I) Wish / Needed to Know Sooner. A small docs repo for me to jot down some linux/mac basics. Very WIP

The plan is to just gather a bunch of small tutorials here to get people with little or no experience started with basic CLI usage on linux/mac terminals, package management, bash/scripting, and (ofc) Git/Version control. The plan is for this to be a living document.

I will probably need for some editor at some point since my writing is very train-of-thought and that usually doesn't make things more readable. You have been warned :D
